# what i'm up to right now
*as of 17 feb 2026*

## career
Had a good first six months at Meta, starting to meet people and learn more about the interactions b/w
my team and the rest of FB. Trying my best to navigate the New World Order of using (but not
abusing) LLMs in software engineering. LLMs make a lot of things much more convenient but also
run the risk of being turned into a crutch. So I still need to *know* what the LLM is doing
while also still scaling productivity or whatever my CEO is yapping about.
Thankfully unlike [some other companies](https://amazon.com) we
aren't being token limited so I have a good playground to figure out this balance.

## personal life
Going through an adjustment right now after moving from the Bay, where I've lived my whole life, to
Seattle, where I never imagined living right up until I was told I had to go there. Hopefully making
a somewhat positive name in the Washington State car community. Also hope to take advantage of the
lack of vehicle inspection while I'm up here and "build my dreams".

Probably working on becoming a better person by any means necessary. I do think I'm a generally
solitary person but that should change. However companionship is earned and I can't really get much
of that just sulking around and being sad all day. I'll need to put in effort and find motivation.

Improving my skiing skills somewhat to the point where I can confidently go down well-groomed black
diamonds. Unfortunately, my friends will NOT let me forget that I'm still the slowest skier in the
Slopes ranking.
