hi all. i have graduated. it's honestly surreal given that 3 years ago i had sworn i'd never graduate early and i'd probably go to grad school.
i think that version of me is punching the air right now. and it's also surreal that with exam grades out, i am permanently done with classes!
i don't know if this is something i'll miss just yet, but maybe this was secretly type 2 fun all along.

why did i graduate early? mostly because i got a job offer at meta early enough to petition an early grad request. moreover burnout from taking
hard classes finally got to me and i decided to take some easier ones this semester. however in this time i've also accomplished a lot outside of class.
most of it's related to the homelab (which is now down because my house has CGNAT LMAO), which i'd postponed for roughly a year due to "lack of time", a
funny codeword i use to mean laziness. i further learned svelte(kit) because ronit said it was good, and applied a lot of the networking concepts from
my classes this semester into practice. this was my first semester doing any form of fully self-guided systems programming projects, which is always 
exciting!

as for the next chapter, i'll be moving to seattle in july with at least 1 road trip up from the bay. for someone who loves cars so much i'm a 
pretty awful driver though, so let's hope i make it in one piece. ostensibly i'll be working in infra although my team and manager haven't been
set yet.
