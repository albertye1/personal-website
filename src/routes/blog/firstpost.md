hi! i have finally gotten a semblance of a blog set up, thanks largely to [Josh Collinsworth](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog)'s tutorial. 

pretty straightforward tutorial, and through it i'm starting to learn how to set up some more dynamic components on this site.
hopefully this is just the first of a couple cool things i can put on here. 

this is a public website, so i hopefully won't overshare, but i do hope to write a mix of technical and nontechnical things on here.
i might also want to throw in some highlights from my 
[old aops blog](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c997575_relatively_consistent_post) on here, although there is 
maybe only one such post i'd want to reshare in the context of a future post.
