*local dumb twink fails at basic car maintenance, is laughed out of room*

## what i tried
- replace the spark plugs
- while i'm in there, also replace the upper engine mount with a part purchased by the previous owner
- don't fuck up

## what actually happened
### dropped a couple washers
  - didn't make the car run any worse so i guess i'll just find and order on ipd
### spent a couple hours extracting one stripped torx t25
  - this one could've been my fault. i think last time i had to take out the charge pipe it got too dark too fast. but i distinctly remember taking out that t25.
  - had to drill into the bolt (sacrificing the bit) and then twist the whole thing out with a slow but large amount of torque
  - the end result: ![blogpic](/blogposts/stripped.jpg)
  - those two ain't coming apart...
### removed the charge pipe and valve covers
  - at this point we should just replace the upper engine mount since it's just four bolts!
### removing the spark plugs...
  - boot for cylinder #2 was absolutely impossible to get rid of
  - plug for cylinder #5 seemed to have some burn
  - plug for cylinder #3 felt like excalibur to pull out.

### reinstallation
  - added anti-seize to the plugs before realizing that NGK plugs aren't supposed to use antiseize
  - used a random M5 screw from ace hardware and a washer that wasn't the same size
  - just didn't put washers in the nut and bolt assembly for the crossbar. i'd be so mad if i lost the other washer so i just didn't bother
  - very rational dread that something's just gonna come off or break while i'm driving. torqued everything down though so hopefully it would be ok
### improvements
  - very slight reduction in car vibrations on idle. i'll do a more exhaustive test drive that will probably lead to my entire engine falling apart today, i think.

## lessons learned
- flex head ratchets are GOATED
- need magnet on a stick so i stop dropping easy-to-lose mechanical parts.
- modern spark plugs, especially ones by NGK, do **not** need antiseize. too much antisize will lead to a misfire or smth. they also have zinc heads which don't need antiseize to function.
